# App Architecture
The main tools used for Whisperify: 
* Angular: used for the frontend of the application. 
* NodeJS: used to host the backend, make API calls, and communicate with the database. Express is used to create a RESTful API. 
* MongoDB: store user statistics for use in quiz score percentile calculation, Whisperify audio feature analysis, and generated challenges. 
* Vercel: hosts the NodeJS app as a serverless application. 
* Spotify API: used to obtain song and user data from Spotify.
